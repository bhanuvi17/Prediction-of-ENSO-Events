# ENSO Time Series Prediction using LSTM

This project performs time series prediction of the Oceanic Ni√±o Index (ONI) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The ONI time series is extracted from the dataset `ENSO1.csv`, and the model forecasts the ONI values for the next few months based on historical data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Plotly
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


This is a clean `README.md` file that provides a high-level overview of the project, its dependencies, dataset, steps, and possible future improvements. You can copy and paste this into your `README.md` file directly. Let me know if you need anything else!
